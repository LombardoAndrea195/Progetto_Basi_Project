#PROGETTOBASI(made with Eclipse and SceneBuilder for the implementation, StarUML for the documentation, POSTGRES for the managment of the database,JUNIT fot the testing process): Link:(https://github.com/LombardoAndrea195/Project/tree/master/PROGETTOBASI) The main goal of this Java project is to build a laptop stand alone application which let me import information from CSV files into a database. The data collected into CSV files should come up from Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica, infact we have information of different celestial bodies(more precisesly Stars and filaments) by more satellites. The documentation is inside of this directory and there are: -the diagrams Entity-Relationship -the logic model(dictionary of data, business rules, class diagram, test case and database's dump made on PostgresSQL). The application should allow to the user to loggin in with the profiles of users(Administrator-User). The different of them is about the the type and number of operations(actions) they could do. The communication between application client and database is made with a JDBC approach. The patterns used into this project are: for the architecture MVC and for creation database and controller we use the pattern Singleton.
